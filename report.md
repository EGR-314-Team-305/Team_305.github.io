## Team Organization

### **Charter**

The team will operate with the following goals throughout the semester:

1. **Work together to create a functional technical product that solves a real-world problem:**

    The primary goal is for the team to work together on creating a technical solution to a practical, real-world issue. This involves identifying a problem or need, brainstorming potential solutions, and then narrowing down the idea to a feasible and impactful project. The product should not only be functional but also innovative, addressing the real-world problem in a way that adds value and makes a tangible difference.

2. **Gain experience with electronics and embedded system design with a microcontroller:**

    Team members will deepen their understanding of electronics and embedded systems by working directly with microcontrollers. This experience includes designing circuits, programming the microcontroller, and integrating various electronic components. The goal is to develop proficiency in both hardware (sensors, actuators, communication modules) and software (embedded programming, interfacing, and debugging) aspects of the system.

3. **Maximize work efficiency through extensive planning and proper time management:**

    Efficient teamwork relies on solid planning and time management. The team will need to create a comprehensive project timeline, breaking down the work into manageable tasks, setting deadlines, and assigning responsibilities. Proper organization is key to ensuring that all team members contribute effectively, progress is steady, and roadblocks are anticipated and addressed promptly.

4. **Develop a final product to showcase the team members’ newfound knowledge and experience utilizing embedded systems:**

    The culmination of the project will be a final product that embodies the collective knowledge and experience gained during the process. This product should not only solve the identified problem but also serve as a demonstration of the team’s newly acquired expertise in electronics and embedded system design. The project should reflect the practical application of theoretical concepts and provide insight into the team's learning journey.

5. **Present our final project in a presentation to effectively communicate the team’s knowledge to the class and the client:**

    The team will prepare a formal presentation to showcase their project, explaining the problem, the development process, the technical design, and the final product. The presentation should clearly communicate the technical aspects of the solution, demonstrate how it addresses the identified real-world problem, and highlight the team’s growth in technical and collaborative skills. Tailoring the presentation to the audience will ensure that the key points are delivered effectively and comprehensively.


### **Product Mission Statement**

Our mission is to design and develop a product that aims to incorporate the use of sensors that are able to gauge the different factors in its surrounding environment and transmit that newly obtained data through a serial communication protocol, utilizing only surface mounted components. 

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

### **Listing and Grouping Needs**

During the very early stages of this class the team wanted to make something that was slightly different from a mobile weather station. Instead the team wanted to look toward making a product that was used in a cooking setting. The team wanted a product that could be used to help regulate the storage and preservation of foods or even create a device that could provide more accurate readings for something like a meat smoker or grill. So during the benchmarking process the team picked products on the market that related to cooking in some way. For our five products two were temperature sensors, two were cooking tools, and one was a product that cooled a person down which is very handy in those grilling environments. We did this so as to find needs that would relate to our future product. The team then looked through the reviews of each product and found six positive and six negative reviews. Utilizing these reviews the team was then able to create ten user needs for each product, with half of them being explicit needs and the other being latent needs. In total the team found fifty needs and grouped them into a jamboard.

### **Converting Needs**

For the process of converting the needs into specifications the team created four categories that were used to group the user needs in. The four categories included: cost effectiveness, user friendliness, reliability, and wireless connectability. After color coding and grouping the needs the team ranked the user needs in each category. This was done using a one to three star scale, with three stars being an important user need, two stars being somewhat important and one being a less important user need. The ranking the user need received was based on two factors. The first was how prevalent that user needs was in the reviews and the second was based on how broad the user need was.We wanted broad user needs so that they encompassed the more specific user needs. For example the user need that stated the device needed to be easy to install, received three stars. Whereas the user needs that stated the probe must be easy to position, received a one star rank. The team then looked at the top ranked user needs and converted those into specifications that could be measurable to see if we met the needs of the user. 

### **Design Aspects**

Our design aspects are grouped into six categories. These include product design, software/functionality, interactivity & User experience, customization, manufacturing and safety. The top aspects in each category include designing a device that is unique from existing products, making a device that will communicate with an online server via ESP 32 module, making sure the device will work with different devices, allowing the user to customize the device to meet a certain goal, making each subsystem at a reasonable cost, and lastly making sure the device is not harmful to the user in any way. The rest of the design aspects are listed in Appendix B: 

## Design Ideation

### **Generating Ideas**

For generating ideas the team first referenced the user needs and came up with ideas that met those user needs. After coming up with small basic ideas the process evolved into coming up with basic products that utilized those features. Throughout this process the team bounced off each other and added their own twist to each idea, this led to us generating a lot of ideas prior to our brainstorming process. This was important as it gave us direction during our brainstorming process. The roles for this process were relatively simple, Victor record the different ideas and made note of the top ideas, Derek came up with the top idea and led the discussion, Scott did research on different ideas and looked to find similar products on the market, and Andrew grounded each idea by making sure that we could implement the required sensors and actuators. 

### **Brainstorming**

The brainstorming process started out by creating a jamboard and coming up with different features we wanted to see in our kitchen device. After brainstorming features, we then began to brainstorm more fleshed out ideas such as how the features would work together and how a feature could trigger an actuation. We planned on brainstorming all one hundred features in one go but the team found that the ideas were being repeated or were simply dull. So collectively the team decided to split the brainstorming process over the span of 2 days. This approach definitely helped and allowed us to come up with strong ideas each day. During this process we also began to add ideas for features that could be seen in products that were not necessarily related to cooking. The team came to the conclusion that brainstorming for other products could lead us to new innovative ideas that could benefit the kitchen product we had in mind. In the end the team came up with 100 ideas.

### **Organization and Concepts**

After concluding the brainstorming process the team came up with three concept ideas. Those three ideas were the meat smoker measuring device, the freezer regulating device, and the rc cave crawler. Related ideas from the brainstorming session were then grouped under the concept that they best reinforced. To provide a visual aid of our different concepts the team created computer generated images and the top concept also included a detailed vector sketch of the concept at work. Derek created the vector image for our top concept, the freezer regulating device. A computer generated image of the freezer regulator also accompanied the image. Scott made a concept image for the meat smoker measuring device. Lastly Victor made a concept image for the rc cave crawler. Each of these concepts were accompanied by short descriptions of the features that would be included in each concept. To see the concept images and jamboards visit Appendix C: Design Ideation.

### **Meeting Schedule & Coordination**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f508e57-867d-42f2-a497-bb3e27d5bac4)


### Weekly Meeting Procedure:



1. **What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings?** We will use our group chat on Discord to remind each other of meetings and stay up to date regarding team assignments. The meeting leader will also be following a google calendar with important due dates that will be shared with the team. 
2. **How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?** We will meet collectively and decide which times work best for the group. This can be done either through a virtual Zoom call or in-person meeting.
3. **What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?** Both formats are equally preferred; it's a matter of what seems the most efficient. For hands-on work we will meet face to face, for writing assignments virtual meetups will suffice. 
4. **Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary?** No other procedures are needed for the team.

1. **How often will you change project roles?** Every month there will be a role change, this will allow for everyone to experience each role once. 
2. **How will you decide who is assigned to each role?** Understanding what goals need to be met will drive the team's decision making on who gets what role and during what month, each member can only take on a role once.
3. **How will team members help one another meet their responsibilities?** Constant communication with one another will allow the team to come up with plans to tackle responsibilities. This means each member will always be relaying to the team what they are working on, when they are working on it, and how they will go about tackling their problem. This transparency allows everyone to be in the loop and help will be there if a problem arises. 
4. **How will you identify and respond to situations in which the team must adjust roles and responsibilities?** The team will conduct a team meeting virtually and will go over which roles will be changed.** **
5. **How will you track the team activities and milestones?** Through the use of a Gantt chart the team will be able to plan out a roadmap all the way to our functional prototype.
6. **How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members?** As a team we will discuss what is the best possible course to take so that each member is assigned a technical responsibility that they are best suited to take on. 

### **Team Coordination and Accountability**

Each team member will be notified by the assignment leader before submitting an assignment via the group text and will seek approval from each of the other team members before submitting. The same will be true with the team’s design review. In the case that a team member doesn’t have the knowledge to complete an assignment, the other team members will explain and clarify the necessary information to solve the problem until they can solve it. Transparency is something that will be encouraged in our meetings and other communication modes. If for whatever reason one team member can not complete their assigned task the remaining group members will work on the missed task together. The teammate that missed did not do their task will get warned then referred to the professor if it happens again. To make sure everyone is held accountable and each team member has to report to the group chat when they are going to work on the assignment at the time. After they have completed their portion they must again report the changes and updates they made during their time working on the assignment. 

### **Conflict Recognition and Resolution**

In the case that some contribution or assignment is missed, the group will talk at the weekly meeting and discuss what can be done moving forward to resolve the problem and how to improve for later. Each team member is responsible for their portion of the project and is accountable for the expectations laid out in the charter. If a conflict arises, it should be recognized by the involved parties and worked out together as a team. A team controversy is normal and should be discussed openly to determine the best option for the project goals. If a solution is not found in a timely manner the team has agreed on a votes based system when regarding decision making or differing opinions. In the case that a specific team member is not performing all of the necessary work, the group will try to resolve the issue amongst themselves during the group meetings as well as help them to improve. If a team member repeatedly fails to meet the expectations, intervention by the professor will be needed. A pink slip will be given to them with consequences to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the professor.

* Positive Statements
    * “The user was impressed with the IQ110 on their Weber, finding it very easy to use and effective at maintaining a consistent low and slow temperature for 8 hours using only a handful of briquettes. They added a single chunk of apple wood for smoke, which proved sufficient as the smoke was well-contained.” 5 Star Review
    * “The IQ110 provided essential guidance for managing charcoal quantity and setup issues, making it a valuable tool for effective temperature control during long, slow cooks.” 4 Star Review
    * “The user used the IQ110 twice on their Weber 22.5 kettle and found it performed exactly as hoped, without encountering any of the negative issues reported online.” 5 Star Review
* Negative Statements
    * “The user struggled with the device on their PBC for 2.5 years, finding the concept promising but ultimately disappointing as it frequently malfunctioned despite numerous resets and proper storage.” 1 Star Review
    * “The user bought a temperature control unit for their WSM 18.5 smoker to manage temperatures during long smokes, finding it generally effective but with a 15°F temperature variance compared to their digital probes. After a year of use, the unit failed by getting stuck on "lid open" status and not blowing air properly, despite careful maintenance. Frustrated with its reliability, the user decided to replace it with a Flame Boss FB200 for its WiFi capabilities, opting not to risk another unit failing in a year.” 1 Star Review
    * “The user is struggling to position the temperature probe accurately with their Vision Kamado Classic smoker/grill after four uses, trying various routes and placements without success. They are concerned that the probe might be damaged despite its appearance being unchanged and are comparing its readings with a reliable grill thermometer and another thermometer placed in different spots. They plan to update their review once they find a reliable method for achieving accurate temperature readings.” 3 Star Review
* User Needs Statements
    * Ease of Use: The device should be straightforward to use and simple to set up and operate. (explicit)

Introduction

For this semester’s EGR 314 project class section, a device that uses two forms of environmental sensing that is then used to influence the control of a motor. To this end, Team 305 is looking at devices that manage temperatures based on external factors like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The actuation requirement would then be fulfilled by a motor powering a mechanism that adjusts the temperature as needed.

Objectives

The team aims to achieve the project requirements by performing market research, developing the skills necessary to implement sensing and actuation, and implement the chosen solution as a prototype. The end product will be something from which each team member will take away a valuable skill and potentially bring the prototype to market. With the appropriate market research, the team hopes to create something novel and useful that consumers would consider a marked improvement over other products.

**Appendix C: Design Ideation**

**Process:**

For the design ideation process the group began by brainstorming ideas for potential devices that could be used to monitor and somehow regulate temperature and humidity. The group encouraged each other to throw out any ideas. Ideas ranged from features we wanted to see, to potential use cases, and even extra components that we could throw in to complement the sensors and actuators that we were required to use. All the ideas were thrown onto the jamboards.

At the end of the brainstorming session we were able to come up with one hundred notes of ideas and features. We then used these ideas and came up with three concept designs. Two of which assist with monitoring the environment in a cooking setting and the third has to do with monitoring underground environments such as caves. Using Dall-E 3 we generated three images of our concepts along with a description of features that accompany each concept. Below are screenshots of the jamboards and images of each concept.
